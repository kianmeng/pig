                        PIGSTY ENTERPRISE EDITION
                    END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
                      Last Updated: January 1, 2025

This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) governs the use and licensing of
Pigsty Enterprise Edition (the “Licensed Software”). If you (an individual,
company, or other entity, collectively the “User”) have entered into a valid
Software License and Services Agreement or other commercial subscription
agreement (the “Commercial Subscription License”) with the owner of the
Licensed Software’s copyright and related intellectual property rights (the
“Licensor” or “Seller”), your use of the Licensed Software during the
Subscription Term (defined below) is subject to both this EULA and the
Commercial Subscription License. If you have not obtained a Commercial
Subscription License, you may only use the Licensed Software under the
AGPLv3 (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0) and must fulfill all
open‑source compliance obligations (including making source code publicly
available).

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
 - During the valid Subscription Term, you may lawfully use Pigsty Enterprise
   Edition and are exempt from the AGPLv3 obligations concerning source code
   disclosure.
 - If you do not have a Commercial Subscription License (or if the
   Subscription Term has expired and you continue using the Licensed
   Software), you revert to the AGPLv3 framework and must comply with all
   open‑source requirements. The Licensor assumes no responsibility or
   liability in such a scenario.

rights in Pigsty Enterprise Edition, including its successors or affiliates.

1.3 “User/You”
Means any individual, company, or other organization that receives,
downloads, copies, installs, accesses, or otherwise uses the Licensed
Software.

1.4 “Commercial Subscription License”
Refers to the commercial license that the User obtains by entering into a

Subscription Term.

1.5 “Subscription Term”
Means the period or term specified in the Commercial Subscription License

considered Derivative Works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SCOPE OF LICENSE

2.1 Commercial Use License
During the Subscription Term, provided the User has fully paid the required
fees and complies with this EULA and the Commercial Subscription License, the
Licensor grants the User a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, and
non‑sublicensable right to use the Licensed Software within the agreed scope
(e.g., number of nodes, instances, or servers). This includes:
 - Installing, running, and accessing the Licensed Software for the User’s
   internal business operations;
 - Receiving and using updates, patches, or improvements to the Licensed
   Software during the Subscription Term.

Note: If the Subscription Term expires or is terminated without renewal or
re‑issuance of a Commercial Subscription License, the User’s right to
continue using the commercial edition will immediately cease.

2.2 Exemption from Open-Source Obligations
If the User has a valid Commercial Subscription License, the User is exempt
from the AGPLv3 obligations concerning source code disclosure and derivative
works during the Subscription Term. However, if the Subscription Term has
ended or the User never obtained a Commercial Subscription License, the
Licensed Software is automatically governed by AGPLv3, and the User must
assume and fulfill all open‑source compliance obligations. The Licensor
disclaims any liability in that regard.

2.3 Restrictions
Except as expressly permitted by this EULA or the Commercial Subscription
License, the User shall not:
 1. Sell or provide to third parties any derivative products based on the
    Licensed Software without the Licensor’s prior written consent (except as
    noted in Section 2.4 below);
 2. Remove, obscure, or modify any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary
    notices within the Licensed Software;
 3. Transfer, sublicense, rent, outsource, co‑host, or otherwise provide the
    Licensed Software to any third party in its entirety;
 4. Reverse‑engineer, decompile, or attempt to obtain the source code of any
    non‑open‑source portions of the Licensed Software;
 5. Engage in any activity beyond the express scope of this EULA or the
    Commercial Subscription License.

2.4 DBaaS Usage
If the User packages or integrates the Licensed Software into a
Database‑as‑a‑Service (“DBaaS”) offering and provides it to third parties
(whether for free or for consideration), and such use is expressly authorized
or prohibited under the User’s Commercial Subscription Contract or supplemental
agreements with the Licensor, such usage is deemed a valid and permissible 
means of deployment.
 - The User, when offering DBaaS, must still comply with all provisions of
   this EULA and the Commercial Subscription License, and shall not modify
   or distribute the Licensed Software outside the scope permitted by the
   Licensor.

2.5 High-Risk Environments
Without the Licensor’s prior written consent, the User shall not deploy the
Licensed Software in life‑support systems, nuclear facilities, aerospace
controls, or any other applications bearing significant public safety risks.
If the User proceeds without authorization, the User assumes all related
risks and liabilities, and the Licensor shall not be responsible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

3.1 User Obligations
 - Compliance: The User shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
   to ensure lawful use of the Licensed Software in its jurisdiction.
 - Security and Confidentiality: The User shall implement reasonable
   technical and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized access or
   use of the Licensed Software and protect any confidential information
   involved.
 - Payment and Cooperation: If the User requires technical support or
   consulting services from the Licensor, the User shall pay the relevant
   fees and cooperate in accordance with the Commercial Subscription License.
 - Data and Privacy Liability: If the User utilizes the Licensed Software to
   store, process, or transmit personal or sensitive data, the User assumes
   full responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws.
   The Licensor disclaims any liability for data protection compliance.
   Should any dispute, loss, or claim arise related to such data usage, the
   User shall bear sole responsibility.
 - Notification: The User shall promptly notify the Licensor of any piracy,
   misuse, or suspected infringement involving the Licensed Software and
   cooperate in any required actions.

3.2 Licensor’s Rights and Obligations
 - Technical Support: The Licensor shall provide the User with the
   corresponding level of technical support, updates, patches, or
   improvements as specified in the Commercial Subscription License.
 - Retention of IP Rights: The Licensor retains all intellectual property
   rights in and to the Licensed Software and any updates, patches, or
   derivative work thereof. The User is authorized only within the scope
   expressly stated in this EULA and the Commercial Subscription License.
 - “As Is” for Modifications or Out‑of‑Scope: If the User modifies the
   Licensed Software or uses it in a manner outside the Licensor’s supported
   scope, the Licensor provides no warranty or after‑sale service for such
   modified parts or resulting issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

4.1 Ownership
All copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property
rights related to the Licensed Software reside with the Licensor. Unless
expressly granted under this EULA or the Commercial Subscription License, the
User acquires no additional rights.

4.2 Confidentiality
 - Confidential Information: Any non‑public information (e.g., source code,
   technical documentation, product roadmap) obtained by the User through use
   of or support for the Licensed Software shall be deemed confidential
   information of the Licensor.
 - Obligation: The User shall not disclose such information to any third
   party or use it beyond the scope authorized by this EULA or the Commercial
   Subscription License, unless the User has the Licensor’s prior written
   consent or is required by law/regulatory demand to disclose.
 - Survival: The obligations in this Section survive expiration or
   termination of this EULA until such information ceases to be confidential
   or the Licensor provides a written waiver.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY LIMITATION

5.1 Limited Warranty
 - For Users who hold a valid Commercial Subscription License during the
   Subscription Term, if the Licensed Software exhibits significant
   functional or quality defects, the Licensor shall, in accordance with the
   Commercial Subscription License, provide fixes, patches, or reasonable
   replacements.
 - Beyond that, the Licensed Software (particularly with respect to any
   user‑made modifications or use beyond the Licensor’s support scope) is
   provided “as is,” and the Licensor makes no warranties or commitments
   regarding defects or after‑sale service for such modified parts.
 - For those without a Commercial Subscription License or who continue using
   the Licensed Software after the Subscription Term (thus reverting to
   AGPLv3), the Licensor disclaims any commercial warranty, merchantability,
   or fitness for a particular purpose.

5.2 IP Infringement Guarantee and Indemnification Limit
 - The Licensor warrants that it owns or has lawful rights to the Licensed
   Software and does not intentionally infringe any third‑party IP rights by
   providing the Licensed Software itself. If a third party makes a claim
   against the User alleging that the Licensed Software itself (unmodified by
   the User) infringes such party’s intellectual property rights, and the
   alleged infringement is not caused by the User’s own modifications or
   misuse, the Licensor may, within its reasonable control, provide remedies
   such as a fix, replacement, or refund of the Commercial Subscription
   License fees (if applicable) to resolve the infringement risk.
 - Under no circumstances shall the Licensor’s direct liability or remedial
   measures for such infringement claims exceed the total Commercial
   Subscription License fees actually paid by the User.
 - If the alleged infringement arises from the User’s modifications,
   incorporation of third‑party components, or breach of this EULA or the
   Commercial Subscription License, the Licensor assumes no liability.

5.3 Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law:
 1. The Licensor is not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages (e.g., loss of profits, data loss, or reputational
    harm);
 2. The Licensor’s cumulative liability is generally limited to the fees
    actually paid by the User under the Commercial Subscription License;
 3. The Licensor bears no responsibility for any disputes or damages arising
    from the User’s use or distribution of the Licensed Software under AGPLv3
    (including merging, derivative works, or open‑source release).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. TERM AND TERMINATION

6.1 Effective Date and Duration
 - This EULA takes effect on the date the User first downloads, installs, or
   uses the Licensed Software under the Commercial Subscription License and
   remains in force until the Subscription Term expires or the Commercial
   Subscription License is terminated. If the User fails to renew or
   reacquire a Commercial Subscription License, the User must promptly cease
   using the commercial edition and remove or destroy all copies, or revert
   to the AGPLv3 open‑source version.
 - Termination of this EULA does not discharge the User from any payment or
   confidentiality obligations incurred during its validity.

6.2 Termination for Breach
 - If the User materially breaches this EULA or the Commercial Subscription
   License (e.g., non‑payment, unauthorized or excessive use, infringement of
   the Licensor’s IP), the Licensor may terminate this EULA immediately and
   hold the User liable for resulting damages.
 - Unless otherwise agreed in writing, upon termination the User must cease
   all use and destroy or delete all copies of the Licensed Software.

6.3 Survival
Provisions regarding Intellectual Property & Confidentiality (Section 4),
Warranties & Liability (Section 5), and any clauses which by nature should
continue, shall survive the termination of this EULA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
 - If the User has executed a Commercial Subscription License, any dispute
   relating to this EULA may be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution
   and governing law provisions set forth in that license.
 - If the User does not hold a Commercial Subscription License and only uses
   the Licensed Software under AGPLv3, then disputes are principally governed
   by AGPLv3. For matters not covered by AGPLv3, the Licensor may seek relief
   before a court or competent authority in its own jurisdiction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. MISCELLANEOUS

8.1 Entire Agreement
 - This EULA and the Commercial Subscription License collectively represent
   the entire legal framework for the Licensed Software. In the event of any
   conflict, the Commercial Subscription License prevails.
 - For Users without a Commercial Subscription License, AGPLv3 and this EULA
   are mutually exclusive; AGPLv3 is the primary legal basis for the User’s
   use of the Licensed Software.

8.2 Amendments
 - The Licensor may reasonably amend this EULA for business or compliance
   reasons and announce such amendments via its code repository or official
   website. If an amendment would materially adversely affect the User’s
   rights, the Licensor shall provide prior notice or consult with the User.
 - The User’s continued use of the Licensed Software after the amendment’s
   effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. If the User
   disagrees, the User must cease using the Licensed Software immediately.

8.3 Force Majeure
 - Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its
   reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, war, public health
   emergencies, or governmental actions), provided that the party promptly
   notifies the other and takes reasonable steps to mitigate losses.

8.4 Assignment
 - The User may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this
   EULA without the Licensor’s prior written consent.
 - The Licensor may assign or transfer this EULA to an affiliate, successor,
   or entity acquiring relevant rights or obligations (such as through merger
   or restructuring) without the User’s consent.

8.5 Severability
 - If any provision of this EULA is found invalid or unenforceable, it shall
   be deemed severed to the minimum extent necessary, without affecting the
   remaining provisions.
